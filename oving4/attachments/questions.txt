1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?
Answer: The reason for mobile devices to ignore autoplay was to protect the users bandwidth on the mobile device.
However I found that recently this has been reversed. Now they are required to have muted as well as autoplay if they are to play.
2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a device with 320 x 568 resolution?

3. Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of dedicated versions like
