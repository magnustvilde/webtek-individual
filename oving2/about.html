            <p>During VGS I took the courses IT1 and IT2, there I was introduced to a small amount of HTML and CSS coding. I am now a fourth year student at "Lektorutdanning i realfag" with maths and informatics as my subjects.</p>
            <p>I wish to learn some fundamentals about HTML coding, I have not yet this in my courses. I have taken quite a few information technology courses prior to this course.</p>
            <p>My expectations is that this course will teach me fundamentals about HTML and CSS, hopefully other tips and tricks as well. I am very much looking forward to this course!</p>

            <p>I will presume you want concise answers.</p>
            <p>1.   What does the server in the client architecture do?</p>
            <p>Answer: The server provides a service requested by one the client(s). The server is considered a resource.</p>
            <p>2.   What does the client do?</p>
            <p>Answer: The client requests a service from the server.
               I.e. the client requests a service from the server and the server responds.</p>
            <p>3.   What is an IP address?</p>
            <p>Answer: An IP address a way to address a component connected to the internet.
               It is a unique string for that specific component.</p>
            <p>4.   What is DNS?</p>
            <p>Answer: DNS stands for Domain Name System. DNS translates the Domain Name of wherever you are trying to access
               to its IP address.</p>
            <p>5.   What is the difference between the Internet and WWW?</p>
            <p>Answer: The Internet is a network that consists of multiple networks of various sizes.
               The WWW is the system we use to access the Internet. I.e. the Internet is a set of hosts and the WWW is how
               we connect to these hosts.</p>

                <h2>Questions assignment 2</h2>
            </header>
            <p>1.   Why does inline style CSS override rules defined in style elements and external stylesheets?</p>
            <p>Answer: The stylesheet is run before the html file is loaded, and the style element is also run before the
               actual inline style CSS is run, which means it will be overwritten by the inline CSS.</p>
            <p>2.   Give a brief example of when to use ID ( #id ) and when to use classes ( .class ) in CSS.</p>
            <p>Answer: ID-tags are useful if you want to make a specific section of the code behave in a specific way.
               Classes are useful for the same reason, but are used in a different way.
               An element can be linked to a class and inherit its properties by writing class="name-of-class"
               in the head of the specific element.</p>
            <p>3.   What does RGBA mean and what colors can you express with it?</p>
            <p>Answer: Red, Green, Blue, Alpha. RGBA can express 140+ colors and the Alpha value decides how transparent
               the object will be. The 140+ colors represent any color you can think of, but not necessarily all of its shades.</p>
            <p>4.   Why do we include CSS files inside the head element and not inside the body element?</p>
            <p>Answer: The head is read before the body is read, which means the CSS will already be loaded when we start reading
               the body element. This means the users will see some of the CSS before they see the actual content of the webpage.</p>
            <p>5.   What CSS selector matches all the p elements inside the article element in the following HTML?</p>
            <p>Answer: The "article p" will select all 'p' elements inside the 'article' element.
